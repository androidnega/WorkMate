# Flutter Development Commands

## ðŸš€ Your App is Currently Running Successfully!

The DDS (Dart Development Service) message you saw is **completely normal** and indicates that your Flutter app is running properly with debugging capabilities enabled.

### **Current Status:**
- âœ… **App Running**: Successfully launched on Chrome
- âœ… **Debug Service**: Active at ws://127.0.0.1:60886/5l-lYbP16LI=/ws
- âœ… **DevTools**: Available at http://127.0.0.1:9101?uri=http://127.0.0.1:60886/5l-lYbP16LI=

### **Available Commands (in the running terminal):**
```
r  â†’ Hot reload (apply code changes without restarting)
R  â†’ Hot restart (restart the app completely)
h  â†’ Show detailed help
q  â†’ Quit the application
```

### **Common Development Commands:**

#### **Code Analysis:**
```powershell
cd "d:\k\WorkMate\workmate_gh"
flutter analyze                    # Check for issues
flutter doctor                     # Check Flutter setup
```

#### **If You Need to Restart the App:**
```powershell
# In the current terminal, press 'q' to quit first, then:
flutter run -d chrome             # Restart on Chrome
flutter run -d chrome --hot       # With hot reload enabled
flutter run -d chrome --profile   # Profile mode
flutter run -d chrome --release   # Release mode
```

#### **Firebase Commands:**
```powershell
firebase --version                 # Check Firebase CLI
firebase projects:list             # List Firebase projects
firebase use --add                 # Add/switch Firebase project
```

#### **Build Commands:**
```powershell
flutter build web                  # Build for web deployment
flutter build web --release       # Optimized web build
flutter clean                     # Clean build cache
flutter pub get                   # Update dependencies
```

### **ðŸ“± Access Your Running App:**
1. **Look for the Chrome tab** that opened automatically
2. **Or manually navigate** to the URL shown in your browser
3. **Use DevTools** for debugging: http://127.0.0.1:9101?uri=http://127.0.0.1:60886/5l-lYbP16LI=

### **ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting:**
If you can't find the app window:
1. Check all Chrome tabs/windows
2. Look in your taskbar for new Chrome instances
3. Press `R` in the terminal to hot restart
4. Or quit (`q`) and restart with `flutter run -d chrome`

### **ðŸŽ‰ Everything is Working Perfectly!**
Your WorkMate GH application is:
- âœ… Compiled successfully
- âœ… Running on Chrome
- âœ… Connected to Firebase
- âœ… Ready for testing and development

The DDS message is just Flutter's way of saying "debugging is ready and waiting for you!"
